1)Developed a plant disease detection system using Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Trained a deep learning model on a large dataset of plant images with
various diseases.
2)Implemented image preprocessing techniques such as augmentation, normalization,
and resizing to improve model robustness.
3)Achieved high accuracy in classifying plant diseases which will potentially improving
crop yields and reducing economic losses in agriculture
